#3542 
'''You are given an array nums of size n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to apply some (possibly zero) operations on the array so that all elements become 0.

In one operation, you can select a subarray [i, j] (where 0 <= i <= j < n) and set all occurrences of the minimum non-negative integer in that subarray to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,2]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Select the subarray [1,1] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0].
Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,1]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Select subarray [1,3] (which is [1,2,1]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 1. Setting all occurrences of 1 to 0 results in [3,0,2,0].
Select subarray [2,2] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [3,0,0,0].
Select subarray [0,0] (which is [3]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 3. Setting all occurrences of 3 to 0 results in [0,0,0,0].
Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 3.'''

            if n == 0:
                continue
            if not stack or stack[-1] < n:
                res += 1
                stack.append(n)
        return res

#283 Move zeros to end
'''Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]'''

class Solution:
    def movezeros(self ,nums):
        j=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]!=0:
                nums[j],nums[i]=nums[i],nums[j]
                j+=1
        return nums
